# Chapter 1 Introduction to Personal Computer Hardware

## ESD
* ESD: Electrostatic discharge can occur when there's a buildup of an electric charge (static electricity) that exists on a surface which comes into contact with another.
* At least 3,000 volts of static electricity must build up before a person can feel ESD.
* Less than 30 volts of static electricity can damage a computer component.
* Recommendations:

  1. Keep all components in antistatic bags until you are ready to install them.
  1. Use grounded mats on workbenches.
  1. Use grounded floor mats on work areas.
  1. Use antistatic wrist straps when working inside computers.
	
## Cases
1. Horizontal case
2. Full-size tower
3. Compact tower
4. All-in-one
## Power supplies
1. AT: Advanced Technology: obsolete
2. ATX: Advanced Technology eXtended: obsolete
3. ATX12V: most common
4. EPS12V: high-end desktop models
## Connectors
1. 20-pin or 24-pin slotted connector connects to the motherboard
2. SATA keyed connector connects to disk drivers
3. Molex keyed connector connects to hard drives, optical drives, or other devices
4. Berg keyed connector connects to legacy floppy devices
5. 4-pin or 8-pin auxiliary power connector
6. 6/8-pin PCIe power connector
## Power supply voltage
	• 3.3V & 5V --> digital circus
	• 12V --> run motors in disk drives and fans
	• Single rail, dual rail, or multi rail
## Motherboard
Motherboard is a printed circuit board (PCB) that contains bus, or electrical pathways, that interconnect electronic components.

	1. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
	2. Random Access Memory (RAM)
	3. Expansion slots
	4. Chipset
	5. Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) chip
		a. SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) connects optical drives, hard drives and SSD.
		b. IDE (Integrated drive electronics): 40-pin connector each IDE interface supports a max of two devices.
		c. Internal USB: 19-pin connector
### Motherboard chipset
* Northbridge controls high speed access to the RAM and video card. It also controls the speed at which the CPU communicates with all of the other components.
* Southbridge allows the CPU to communicate with slower speed devices, like hard drive.
